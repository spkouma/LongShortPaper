abstract = {Abstract The article presents the state-of-the-art of alternating physisorption of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes, the so-called ?layer-by-layer? method or ?electrostatic self-assembly? (ESA), for the preparation of thin polymer coatings. In comparison to other, more established self-organization techniques, this recent method is distinguished by its simplicity, versatility, and speed. In particular, the tendency for self-healing is unique. Emphasis is given to the role of the molecular structure of the polyelectrolytes, and to the nature of the support. Also, various parameters for the preparation of multilayer films are highlighted, which are very important due to the kinetic control of the build-up process. The structure of the resulting coatings, their quality and stability, chemical reactions in the films, and potential applications are discussed.},

However, both the Langmuir-Blodgett technique and chemisorption from solution can be used only with certain classes of molecules. An alternative approach-fabrication of multilayers by consecutive adsorption of polyanions and polycations-is far more general and has been extended to other materials such as proteins or colloids. Because polymers are typically flexible molecules, the resulting superlattice architectures are somewhat fuzzy structures, but the absence of crystallinity in these films is expected to be beneficial for many potential applications.]},

The central idea is to first synthesize monodisperse polymer gel nanoparticles, then self-assemble them into a 3D network, and eventually covalently bond them. The covalent bonding contributes to the structural stability, while self-assembly provides them with crystal structures that diffract light, resulting in colors. N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPA) gel has been used as a model system for this study. The nanostructured NIPA gel, which contain up to 97 wt{\%} water, displays a striking iridescence like precious opal but are soft and flexible like gelatin.},

abstract = {Abstract Various strategies are described for the bio-functionalization of solid substrates by design of interfacial architectures. The first approach is based on the self-assembly process of long-chain thiol molecules from solution to a (noble) metal surface. If some of these building blocks carry a binding site (ligand) for proteins (receptors, antibodies, etc.) the metal surface can be tailored for maximum specific binding while simultaneously minimizing nonspecific adsorption. The second concept is based on polymers that are covalently attached to (oxide) surfaces. The preparation of these (end-) grafted functional polymers involves either the binding of preformed macromolecules to corresponding sites at the surface of the support or the recently introduced “grafting-from” method, by which an initiator molecule is first covalently bound to the surface and then activated — either by heat or light — in the presence of suitable monomer units such that a polymer chain grows from the solid/solution interface. Finally, the functionalization of patterned surfaces by peptide chains that mimic the binding domains of cell adhesion proteins is summarized. It is demonstrated that not only the selective adhesion of neuronal cells can then be controlled, but also their development with the outgrowth of dendrites and axons.},
